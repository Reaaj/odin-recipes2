            <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>Pizza Sauce</h3>
            
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated onion</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
            
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 500 Degrees Fahrenheit:
                    If using pizza stone, preheat Pizza in the oven
                    for at least 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Make the sauce: 
                    The recipe for the sauce makes enough
                    for one large pizza. It can easily be doubled.
            </li>
            <li>Roll out dough: 
                    Roll out dough on lightly floured surface.
                    If it's hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can 
                    be at room temperature. For large pizza, roll the dough into 
                    roughly 14-inch diameter circle.
            </li>
            <li>Add the toppings:
                    Transfer dough to lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively put
                    it into a large cast-iron.
                    Add sauce in a light layer all over the pizza, leaveing about
                    1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the pepperoni and 
                    sprinkle over the sauce. Top pizza with grated cheese and the
                    rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>If pizza stone is being used, slide pizza carefully into center
                    of preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the 
                    pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6-8 minutes or 
                    until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots.

                    <i>If skillet is used</i>, press dough into cast iron skillet and 
                    add toppings. Place skillet over high heat burner for 2 minutes to 
                    get it preheated and get crust cooking right away. Then transfer to 
                    500 degree fahrenheit oven and bake for 10-12 minutes or until crust 
                    is golden brown. 
            </li>
            <li>Slice and serve:
                    Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto cutting board.
                    Let pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh 
                    oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    
        <p>This one is simpler than the rest cause of 
            the few ingredients that is used. It's called 
            Yakitori, which is chicken on a stick that is grilled/broiled
            and it's glazed with tasty mirin along with other items
            to make the sauce!!
        </p>

        <p>I also got to try out these Yakitor's in Japan, not too much 
            though so I wouldn't get fat haha. But it's definitely a bargain
            for such a quick bite!

    <h2>Making Yakitori</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Soak the bamboo skewers for 30 minutes. Use 5 inch bamboo teppogushi 
            or "gun skewers" that have a flat tab for a handle or use regular bamboo
            skewers
            </li>
            <li>Thread the skewers with pieces of chicken and Tokyo Negi</li>
            <li>Place the skewers on a oven-safe wire rack coated with oil or
                cooking spray and set it on a foil-linked baking sheet pan. Cover 
                the handles with foil.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the broiler to High, then broil skewers for 6 minutes</li>
            <li>Brush with yakitori sauce, flip and brush the other side, then broil for
                3-4 minutes to caramalize the sauce
            </li>
            <li>Flip the skewers once more, brush them with the sauce, then broil for 1-2
                minutes. Serve immediately.
